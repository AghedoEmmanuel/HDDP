        <h4>1. Diabetes</h4>
        <h5>What is diabetes?</h5>
        <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood
            glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat.<br> Insulin, a hormone made by the
            pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy..</p>
        <h5>What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h5>
        <p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>2. Heart Disease</h4>
        <h5>What is heart disease?</h5>
        <p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease
            umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems
            (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.<br>
            The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease."
            Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that
            can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect
            your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br>
            Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

        <h5>These are symptoms to watch out for</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your
                body are narrowed</li>
            <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
